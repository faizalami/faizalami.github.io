## Hello! I'm Faizal.

I was originally full-stack, but now I choose to focus in front end web.
I am confident in my understanding about Javascript.
In order to understand more deeply about Javascript,
I am developing my own framework called [Fremwok-Fremwokan](https://github.com/faizalami/fremwok-fremwokan).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# deploy
$ yarn generate
$ yarn deploy
```
