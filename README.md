## Faizal Amiruddin Personal Website

I have good skill in programming, especially in web programming using many frameworks. I always learn the concept and the structure of programming language, so I can learn new programming language easily. I am interested in Software Architecture and Software Design Pattern. I have completed my college studies in [Electronics Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya](https://pens.ac.id) with final project about building a Laravel Framework package for design and generate an application without writing code. I have studied Agile Scrum methodology by practice it in building a software in a development team.
